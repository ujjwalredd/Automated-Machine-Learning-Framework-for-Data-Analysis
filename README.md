# Automated-Machine-Learning-Framework-for-Data-Analysis
A machine learning framework for automated data analysis tasks is provided by this code. For feature selection, model training, and model assessment on datasets containing both numerical and categorical characteristics, it makes use of a variety of machine learning methods and techniques.

# Features
* Automated feature selection: The framework includes methods to handle datasets with both numerical and categorical features. It applies appropriate feature selection techniques to select the most relevant features for analysis.
* Multiple machine learning algorithms: The code incorporates a variety of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, logistic regression, random forests, and multi-layer perceptrons, for both classification and regression tasks.
* Hyperparameter optimization: The framework employs grid search to automatically optimize the hyperparameters of the selected machine learning models, improving their performance on the given dataset.
* Cross-validation evaluation: The code performs cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each model. It uses accuracy scores for classification tasks and mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks.
